Built a real-time collaborative code editor with React.js, Express, and Socket.ioâ€”this was created with a
motive to come up with quality code and practice coding problems together, featuring room-based
C++,Java, and Python compilation.
Ensured seamless collaboration by implementing real-time sync, session management, and instant API
compilation feedback.
